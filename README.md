    - The separate code layers of MVVM are:
        - Model: This layer is responsible for the abstraction of the data sources. Model and ViewModel work together to get and save the data.
        - View: The purpose of this layer is to inform the ViewModel about the user’s action. This layer observes the ViewModel and does not contain any kind of application logic.
        - ViewModel: It exposes those data streams which are relevant to the View. Moreover, it serve as a link between the Model and the View.
